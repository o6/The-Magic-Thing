## What the hell? ##

Well, to answer your excellent question, The Magic Thing is a project that I gave up on a while ago. I've decided to open-source it now because I'd love to see someone take it and make it amazing. The concept of TMT was an app that simplified the encoding of videos for the web, for use with the HTML5 video tag. It takes a video file as input, then converts the video file to two output files:  one using h.264, and another using Ogg Theora. That way, you can embed the video online using HTML5 and get the best browser support.  

## Uhh...any plans? ##

None. I'm not planning on doing any more work on it. It'd probably be best if someone added WebM support to it. Or you know, made it reliable. The scripting/parsing of the FFMpeg progress is buggy at best, so improvement there is needed. Batch support would be cool too. Refactoring would be amazing, considering how messy the code is.

Yeah. That's about it. Contact me if you have any questions. Oh, I suppose I should include a license.
